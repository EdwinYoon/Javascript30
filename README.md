# Javascript30

This repository is for me to upload codes that I have been learning these days from the guy Wes Bos's Javascript30 lectures,
It also noticeable that I am not able to understand all those codes, I am trying to understand though.

## Getting Started

Each folder consists of different project and  functions, as Wes Bos is dealing different things in every lectures of his.
Everything that built on this repository consist of HTML, CSS, Javascript.
